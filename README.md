üñêÔ∏è Gesture-Based Math Solver
=============================

A real-time application that combines computer vision, hand gesture recognition, and optical character recognition (OCR) to **recognize handwritten mathematical expressions** and solve them effortlessly. Built using **Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, PaddleOCR, and Streamlit**, this project offers an interactive way to solve mathematical expressions through gestures. It includes an **AI-powered mode** for solving complex expressions with the help of Gemini AI.

üöÄ Features
-----------

*   **Hand Gesture Recognition:**
    
    *   Draw on the screen by raising your **index finger**.
        
    *   Clear the canvas by raising your **thumb**.
        
    *   Solve drawn expressions by raising **all fingers except the pinky**.
        
*   **Real-Time Processing:**Combines live webcam feed with gesture-based drawing and mathematical evaluation.
    
*   **Dual Math Expression Solver Modes:**
    
    *   **Normal Mode**:
        
        *   Uses OCR and SymPy for evaluating handwritten mathematical expressions.
            
        *   Handles subscripts, superscripts, and common OCR challenges.
            
    *   **AI Mode**:
        
        *   Leverages Gemini AI for understanding and solving complex mathematical expressions.

üì∏ How It Works
---------------

1.  **Start the application** to access the webcam feed.
    
2.  **Select a mode**:
    
    *   **Normal Mode** for solving with OCR + SymPy.
        
    *   **AI Mode** for Gemini AI-powered solutions.
        
3.  **Use gestures** to interact with the canvas:
    
    *   Draw mathematical expressions with your finger.
        
    *   Clear the canvas using a thumb gesture.
        
    *   Solve expressions by raising all fingers except the pinky.
        
4.  **Real-time updates** for recognized expressions and results.
